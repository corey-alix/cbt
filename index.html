What went through my mind?  
What disturbed me? 
What did those thoughts mean to me or say about me or the situation?

Take a breath...is this fact or opinion? 
What would someone else say about this situration?  
What is the bigger picture?
Is there another way of seeing it?
What advice would I give someone else?
Is my reaction in proportion to the actual event?
Is this really as important as it seems?
